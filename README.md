## About

The YARG Renderer is a ray casting renderer written from scratch in C#, using the Form library for drawing to the screen in a window.

Currently the renderer supports rendering spheres and planes, with their positions hardcoded into Program.InitializeGeometry

The roadmap for this project has polygon rendering as the next priority, and then a code cleanup pass to follow.
